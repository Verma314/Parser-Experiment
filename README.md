# Parser-Experiment
testing out the Jackson parser

### Step 1 
Get the three Jackson JAR parsers from search.maven.org 
* jackson-core
* jackson-annotations
* jackson-databind

### Step 2 
Add the JARs to your Java CLASSPATH. This is dependant on your IDE etc.

I do not have an IDE, so I am doing it manually.
I pasted the three JARS into the 'lib' folder on my 'jdk'.

And I had to *literally* add the path to each of the three JARs manually into the environment variables in system properties in windows. This will prolly be easy in Eclipse or something.

### Step 3

We gotta use Jackson JSON parser.
